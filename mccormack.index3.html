<p>Walk into any gym in the world, regardless of its size, and you’ll find they all have one thing in common: there will be a bench positioned underneath a secured barbell.</p>
<p>This is because the bench press is a compound movement that targets many of the major muscle groups in the upper body and can be easily overloaded to facilitate progression.</p>
<p>Being one of the most common movements performed in a gym however, it is very often performed incorrectly, inhibiting growth and leading to injury.</p></div>
<div id="content">
<h3>Let's go through the basics of performing a barbell bench press</h3>
<ol>
<li>Lie <b>flat</b> on your back on a bench.</li>
<li>Grip the bar with hands just wider than shoulder-width apart, so when you’re at the bottom of your move your hands are directly above your elbows. This allows for maximum force generation.</li>
<li>Retract your shoulder blades, almost as if you're trying to rip your shirt off. This will <b>significantly</b> reduce your chance of shoulder injury, removing it as a main driver in the movement.</li>
<li>Bring the bar slowly down to your chest as you breathe in.</li>
<li>Push up as you breathe out, gripping the bar hard and watching a spot on the ceiling rather than the bar, so you can ensure it travels the same path every time.</li></ol>
